  <p>About me:
I’m Nicolás from Argentina. I have a background in acoustics, digital signal processing and
audio. In the last couple of years I became interested in deep learning audio applications
and would like to combine my previous knowledge with new and exciting developments.</p>
<p>I have a bachelor degree in Audiovisual Technologies (UNLA) and I’m currently studying to
get a diploma in programming at UTN (Universidad Tecnológica Nacional) in Buenos
Aires. I love science and would like to start contributing in better ways to open source
software projects that are related to my interests.</p>
<p>I found that Asteroid has a great community, there are lots of things to be done and
administrators gave me a warm welcome to their project in their Slack channel. Getting
involved with this project got me into making my first pull request and having it merged to
the source code, so I’m already very happy with the experience.</p>
